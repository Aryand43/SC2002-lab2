## Lab 2: Object-Oriented Design & Programming

This lab contains a Java program (`Lab2p1.java`) that demonstrates various programming concepts through a menu-driven application. It includes methods for multiplication testing, division and modulus using subtraction, digit counting, finding the position of a digit, and extracting odd digits from a number.

A write-up (`Lab2_Writeup.txt`) explaining the focus and methods implemented in this lab is also included.
